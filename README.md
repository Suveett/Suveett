- 👋 Hi, I’m @Suveett
- 👀 I’m specifically interested in Buidling an Appraisal /Social Credit/ 'embedded NFT token locking' Program + Dapp on Solana. In short, a web3 identity solution for non devs, wherein they first get to earn while learning and once they accumulate 50 tokens, then the real Social Game of Referral & slashing starts.   
- 🌱 I've learnt Solidity (Upgradeable Contracts) and built/dummied with improvements some Dapps on ETH  
- 💞️ NFT's excite me and so does DeFi.

Most Fun projects: 
1. Converting a few SC's into one Upgradeable SC on ETH. 
2. Solana Crowd Funding Dapp + Program using Anchor was a real learner for me especially to understand what kind of serializations/ Deserializations Anchor does and also Paul Schaff's Escrow Program really gave me deep insight into Solana's Unique Account Model. 
3. Solana-Blog-Tutorial I Created also helped me in understanding how to allocate space to a Solana account. 
4. Solana-money-dapp-anchor gave me understanding of how to interact with spl-token program library and later i understood some things also around nonces/.
