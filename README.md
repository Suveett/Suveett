Most Fun projects: 
1. Converting a few SC's into one Upgradeable SC on ETH. 
2. 'Solana Crowd Funding Dapp using Anchor' was my attempt at converting a Native Rust program into Anchor and hence was a real learner for me especially understanding how serialization/ Deserialization works in Solana and how Anchor eases the whole thing. Also Paul Schaff's Escrow Program really gave me deep insight into Solana's Unique Account Model. 
3. Solana-money-dapp-anchor gave me understanding of how to interact with spl-token program library and later i understood some things also around nonces.
4. And, now created my own vestor-using-anchor-chainlink-pyth program (basically integrating a Real world use case) 
6. Cli/ js interactions with SERUM DEX, Mango Markets, Orca helped me improve further on my understand of Solana. 
7. Also, further enhanced my knowledge of creating any kind of Tx on Solana (not only spl/sol transfers) and later embed them into QR codes using Solana Pay (eg the new nft-mint project accessing a User's camera to send his Image to IPFS/ nft.storage and later passing the metadata to candy machine v2 and minting a Unique NFT to the user wallet)
7. Created a dummy facebook on solana. 
8. Another goal is to create an Appraisal /Social Credit/ 'embedded NFT token locking' Program + Dapp on Solana.   
9. - 👀 Final Goal : Building a Spiritual Metaverse App called Satyug embedded in Unreal Engine 5 , with amaxing in-Game assets and in-Game AMM and IRL utility of Satyug Goverance tokens.
