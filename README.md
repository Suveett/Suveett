- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Suveett Kalra
  
- ðŸŒ± I've learnt Solidity, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Rust, Anchor (all self taught)
- I've done this so I can finally be code literate and build on Bitcoin and Lightning (because mind you I'm a Bitcoin Maxi)

Most Fun projects: 
1. Converting a few SC's into one Upgradeable SC on ETH. 
2. 'Solana Crowd Funding Dapp using Anchor' was my attempt at converting a Native Rust program into Anchor and hence was a real learner for me especially understanding how serialization/ Deserialization works in Solana and how Anchor eases the whole thing. Also Paul Schaff's Escrow Program really gave me deep insight into Solana's Unique Account Model. 
3. Solana-money-dapp-anchor gave me understanding of how to interact with spl-token program library and later i understood some things also around nonces.
4. And, now created my own vestor-using-anchor-chainlink-pyth program (basically integrating a Real world use case) 
6. Cli/ js interactions with SERUM DEX, Mango Markets, Orca helped me improve further on my understand of Solana. 
7. Also, further enhanced my knowledge of creating any kind of Tx on Solana (not only spl/sol transfers) and later embed them into QR codes using Solana Pay (eg the new nft-mint project accessing a User's camera to send his Image to IPFS/ nft.storage and later passing the metadata to candy machine v2 and minting a Unique NFT to the user wallet)
7. Created a dummy facebook on solana. 
8. Another goal is to create an Idenity + Appraisal + Social Credit based 'NFT token locking' Program + Indexing Dapp.   
9. - ðŸ‘€ Final Goal : Building a 1 min interactive mini-game App called "Satyug" embedded in Unreal Engine 5 or Unity, BabylonJS optimisied so that it run on browsers with low latency and with in-game collectibles, points and 'Karma' NFT's, on top of BTC. The idea is to connect a billion people to Bitcoin and make them use the blockchain (without realizing they are using it: check it out on https://github.com/Satyug-life/Satyug-website). We've already started working on it (currently on Eth Goerli and Polygon and using web3 auth integration), but eventually we will build it on top of Nostr (also zapping around sats using the Lightning Network for in-game asset purchases and exchange of utilities), but absolutely with no shitcoin tokens. Even if we do shitcoins, we will label them as shitcoins, so folks can create their pure utility(without speculation) and play for fun !!
